# ğŸ“Š Data Analysis Protocol for Microfluidic Experiments

This repository provides macros and scripts to support the analysis of pressure/flow sensor data and microscopy images (Brightfield, GFP, FRET) from microfluidic experiments. The protocol uses Fiji (ImageJ) and MATLAB for processing the data.

## **Preparation/Pre-processing**

### **Folder Structure Setup**
- Clone the **`analysis_scripts`** repository from GitHub into the **main root** of the experiment folder.
- Run `create_project_folders.bat` (located in the `analysis_scripts` folder) to automatically generate all required folders and subfolders as below.
- Save all documentation files like `test_report`s or `culture verification` images in the `docs/` folder.

```
MainFolderProject/
â”œâ”€â”€ raw_data/                 # Original, untouched raw data (images, sensor data)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ images/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ sensor_readings/
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ processed_data/           # Final, polished outputs of processing

â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ grain_masks/                # For grain masks, segmentation masks, etc.
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ modified_images/              # For images that have been cropped and aligned
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ biomass_images_*/         # For biomass occupation images based on parameters

â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ logs/                     # Log files (Transforms log, imaging timestamp, and ROI needed for cropping)
â”‚
â””â”€â”€ docs/                     # Project documentation, READMEs, notes
```

### **Copy Sensor Data**
- Place the pressure and flow sensor **`.txt` files in:
  ```
  raw_data/sensor_readings/
  ```
- Use the following filename formats:
  - *Constant pressure experiments:* `pconst_ob1.txt`, `pconst_reader.txt`
  - *Constant flow rate experiments:* `qconst_ob1.txt`, `qconst_reader.txt`

---

### **Copy Experimental Images**
- Copy the Leica imaging project file to:
  ```
  raw_data/images/
  ```
- Export all **RAW IMAGE** channels (Brightfield, GFP, FRET) from **LAS X software** into:
  ```
  raw_data/images/tif_images/
  ```
  as `.tif` files (make sure you choose RAW .
- File naming convention (done automatically by LAS X):
  - `..._ch00.tif` â†’ Brightfield
  - `..._ch01.tif` â†’ GFP
  - `..._ch02.tif` â†’ FRET
> *Note:* If you only need specific images from an image series, you can use the **crop** tools in LAS X software. Simply set the start and end slice to create a new series from your original one.
---

### **Create Imaging Timestamp Log**
- Using `Properties` in **LAS X software**, create an Excel file in the `logs/` folder named:
  ```
  imaging_timestamp.xlsx
  ```
- Include the following columns:
  - `Image#`
  - `Absolute Time`
  - `Date`
- The first row should be:
  ```
  Image# = 0
  ```
  marking the beginning of the experiment.

---

### **Working Section ROI Creation**
- Open **Fiji/ImageJ**
- Load the first Brightfield image from:
  ```
  raw_data/images/tif_images/
  ```
- Draw a rectangular ROI over the micromodel working section.
- In the ROI Manager:
  - Add the selection
  - Rotate via `More > Rotate`
  - Align corners to fit the micromodel edges
  - Add again to the ROI Manager
- Save as:
  ```
  logs/working_area.roi
  ```
### **Background Intensity Coordinates Selection**
To monitor background intensity variations (caused by perturbations such as experimental setup adjustments or lab lighting fluctuations) and ensure they remain within an acceptable range.
- Open **Fiji/ImageJ**
- Load the first Brightfield image from:
  ```
  raw_data/images/tif_images/
  ```
- Draw a rectangular ROI outside of the micromodel and close to the top or bottom edge of the working section.
- Record the **X** and **Y** coordinates of the **top-left** and **bottom-right** corners of this ROI in an Excel file. Organize it with "TOP_LEFT" and "RIGHT-BOTTOM" as column headers and "X" and "Y" as row headers, like this:

    |            | top-left | right-bottom |
    | :--------- | :------- | :----------- |
    | **X** |          |              |
    | **Y** |          |              |

- Save as:
  ```
  logs/int_coordinates.xlsx
  ```

---

## **Process Images**

### **Image Alignment and Cropping (Brightfield Only)**
- Open and run the macro:
  ```
  BF_alignment.ijm
  ```
- Set `channelID = 'ch00'` for Brightfield.
> *Note:* Do **not** use this for GFP or FRET. These will be aligned later using both MATLAB and Fiji.
- After the running is completed, save the log as:
  ```
  logs/transform.txt
  ```

---

### **Image Alignment and Cropping (GFP and FRET)**
- Open MATLAB and run:
  ```
  applyTransforms.m
  ```
- This mfile align (transform) all GFP and FRET images based on the Affine Transform matrices generating by Fiji.
- After the running is completed, open Fiji and run:
  ```
  GFP_FRET_alignment.ijm
  ```
---

### **Mask Refinement**
- Open the following two files as a stack in Fiji:
  - `mask.tif`
  - `t00_ch00.tif` (from `processed_images/modified_images/`)
- Align using SIFT and crop to the original image size.
- Apply outlier removal:
  ```
  Process > Noise > Remove Outliers
  Radius: 7.5 | Threshold: 75 | Outliers: Bright
  ```
- Save the result as:
  ```
  processed_images/grain_mask/mask.tif
  ```

---

### **Biomass Segmentation**
- Open:
  ```
  biomass_segmentation.ijm
  ```
- Set thresholding parameters and run the macro.
- Results are saved in:
  ```
  processed_images/biomass_images_*/
  ```
- Thresholding settings saved as:
  ```
  thresholding_parameters.txt
  ```
